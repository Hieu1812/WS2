A cluster is a logical grouping of services or standalone tasks. The cluster list view provides a snapshot of the status of each of your clusters. This view displays the number of active services and the deployment status of all tasks within the cluster.

The Task definitions view lists each task definition family you've created. You can perform the following actions:

- Deploy the task definition as a service or a task.

- Create a new revision

In this section, we will create ECS with serverless infrastructure (fargate) cluster and launch the application.
